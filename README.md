1.1) week: the week that sale was made after lauching the product.

The sales were made during 1-6 weeks. The data is numeric and, there is not any missing value. Therefore, no action is required.

1.2) sales_method: the three sales method that employees appoach each group of customers

There are three categories of methods: Call, Email, and Call + Email. Although there are no missing values, there are some duplicate categories. The 'email' category is replaced by 'Email', and 'em + call' is replaced by 'Email and Call', as they are the same categories.

1.3) customer_id: this column is a primary key for each customer.

This column contains character values, and they are all 15,000 unique values. Hence, no action is required.

1.4) nb_sold: number of porduct sold

This column contains all numeric values. There are no missing values, hence no action is required.

1.5) revenue: revenue from the sales, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Change data from character to numeric values and replace null values by the median value which is 89.5.

1.6) year_as_customer: number of years customer has been buying from us (company founded in 1984).

This column contains all numerical values. Since 2023, the company has been founded for 39 years. There are some outliers, which are 47 and 63 years; hence, these two rows were dropped.

1.7) nb_site_visits: number of times the customer has visited our website in the last 6 months.

This column contains all numerical values, and there are no missing values. Hence, no action is required.

1.8) state: locations where ordered are shipped. This column contains all character values, and there are no missing values. Hence, no action is required. (total of 50 states)

After the validation and cleaning, the data has 14,998 rows and 9 columns without missing values.

For the last six weeks, we have employed each sales method to approach customers. The results have shown that the email method reached the highest number of customers, totaling 7,465 people. This was followed by the call method, which accounted for nearly 5,000 people. The smallest group of customers contacted by our sales specialists utilized the call + email method, accounting for approximately 50% of the call method.

Let's review the performance of each week. We've observed that the beginning of the week marked the peak of sales, while the sixth week of the campaign had the lowest number of sales. Therefore, if we could motivate the staff to engage customers more actively during the final week of the project, we might be able to generate more sales, as there is room for improvement. The performance during the last week accounted for only half of the performance in other weeks, and it represented only 30% of the peak performance seen in the first week.

What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?

The spread of the revenue is likely to be the right skewed distribution and there are two peaks.

Here is the revenue for each sales method. Since the email method reached the highest number of clients and generated the most sales during the entire campaign period, it also resulted in the highest revenue of approximately $721,000. Surprisingly, the Email + Call method achieved the second-highest total revenue, even though it reached the fewest number of clients. In contrast, the call method accounted for only half of the revenue generated by the email + call method.

1. The boxplot of the call method shows the least spread and the lowest revenue, mainly falling in the range of 40 to 50 US dollar. There is rarely a chance to sell a product that costs over $70. The median for this method is 50 US dollar, which is the lowest.

2. The boxplot of the email method was able to sell the product in the range between 80 and 110 US dollar, occasionally achieving sales of 120 to 150 US dollar. The median for this method is approximately $90, which is the second-highest.

3. The boxplot of the email + call method has yielded remarkably positive outcomes. Sales representatives were able to sell most products between 150 and 190 US dollar, which is the highest range. Additionally, using this method led to sales exceeding 200 to 260 US dollar. The median for this method is approximately $175.

Let's examine the revenue over time for each sales method. Among the methods, the email method generated the highest revenue during the first week of the campaign, reaching nearly 250,000 US dollar, in contrast to the call and email + call methods which could only achieve approximately 25,000 US dollar. However, the email's revenue markedly dropped over the course of the rest of the campaign.

The result of the email method was 10 times higher than that of the others. However, there was an improvement in the email + call method, as its growth gradually increased and surpassed that of the call method from the 3rd to the 6th week of the campaign. Especially in the 5th and 6th weeks, the results of the email + call method were double and triple those of the call method, respectively

Based on the data, which method would you recommend we continue to use? Some of these methods take more time from the team so they may not be the best for us to use if the results are similar

**Business Metrix **

<img width="808" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-18 at 3 45 58 PM" src="https://github.com/Alisa-HP/R-Programming/assets/142073343/3c6fbd6f-0f9b-4852-8b5c-3e6ec6fe935c">

To measure which sales method is the most effective for the team, we will implement the Average Revenue per Customer (ARPC) business metric, and the formula is:

ARPC = Total Revenue/Customer Count

In the table above, we can observe that the email + call method exhibits the highest ARPC, which is 171 US dollar. This is followed by the email and call methods with 97 and 49 US dollar, respectively. Therefore, the most suitable and effective method for the sales team is the email + call method, as it requires less time than the call method (30 minutes per client call) and boasts a significantly higher average revenue per customer. The second-best method is email, which demands relatively less time from the team. However, if the goal is to identify the best solution for revenue growth, then the email + call method stands out as the most efficient option.

Once we choose the email + call method, and in order to determine the initial value based on the provided data, we recommend using the metric of 171. If sales representatives would like to assess potential upselling or downselling of products, they can utilize $171 as the reference number.

Final summary including recommendations that the business should undertake

1. I suggest the team select the email + call method as the primary sales strategy, as it provides the best business metric number.

2. I would recommend continuing to use the email method, as it requires only a small amount of the team's time and can reach customers in significant numbers and locations.

3. Refrain from using the call method, as this experiment showed that even though the sales representatives made calls to individual customers, without customers receiving informative emails, it was not effective enough to persuade them to purchase the products.

4. If the team aims to significantly increase revenue, consider increasing the number of customers for the email + call method. Based on the data, this method had the highest average revenue per customer.

5. Based on the data, sales in the final week of the campaign drastically dropped. Therefore, there is stil room for improvement to increase sales during the 6th week.
   
6. For data improvement, we should collect individual product line data. This way, we can focus on which products are in demand in the current market.
